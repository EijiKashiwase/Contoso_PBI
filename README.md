# Contoso_PBI
Repository created to maintain "Contoso" Power Bi Project.

This project is a exploratory one. The main objective here is use Contoso (since is a huge "company" with a good amount and good quality of data) to build a PBI report using several and different resources.

This PBI uses more resources when we compare with my previous project: Doencas_Cronicas_MG_PivotTable_PBI (https://github.com/EijiKashiwase/Doencas_Cronicas_MG_PivotTable_PBI). Expect to see more complex DAX commands, bookmarks, a better data treatment and data segmentation for different analysis and KPI development.

Every single time that I learn a new resource I will use this report to apply my knowledge and he will be updated too.
